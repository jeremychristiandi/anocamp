# anocamp
A website project to search for available campgrounds in certain areas. The project is created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The website itself is still on development. The main goal is to add a map API, store user information (so user can add a review, leave a comment, and add a rating).
